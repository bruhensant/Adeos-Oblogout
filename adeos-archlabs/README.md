## Adeos-oblogout

A simple style theme for "oblogout", totally made with Inkscape, Love, and also, this edition was specially made for ArchLabs!

To install the theme you will need (of course) "oblogout", the .png files (contained in the theme folder) and go around to find the "oblogout.conf" file (etc/oblogout.conf).

## Instalation 

1 - Go to "etc/oblogout.conf" to edit the file with your favorite text editor (gedit, mousepad, or whatever you prefer).

2 - Modify it by adding "adeos-archlabs" after "buttontheme =" (example: "buttontheme = adeos-archlabs").

3 - Move the "adeos-archlabs" folder to "usr/share/themes".

4 - Enjoy! :D
